phase 1: battle simulator
phase 2: user interface to input stats (like feh combat sim or pokemon showdown)
phase 3: animate replays including fast forward and rewind, import and export - battle sim exports replay
phase 4: backend db to store replays and share via link

possible ideas

skill planner for team

side: self play ai?
e.g. generate 100 random builds -> round robin best of 100
fitness
win: 2
draw: 1
loss: 0
some measure of stat quality
normalise score -> use as probability for pool selection

replay format

{

  left: [players], // for now size will be 1
  right: [players],
  battles: [

  ]
}

battle format
{

alternate event format
{player}|status|add|{status}
{player}|skill|{skill name}
{player}|hp|{amount}|{resulting amount}
{player}|sp|{amount}|{resulting amount}


e.g.
0|skill|barbarism
0|status|add|horns
0|skill|tbox|crit|parry
0|sp|-5|275
1|hp|-100|10000
