phase 1: battle simulator + user interface to input stats (like feh combat sim or pokemon showdown)
phase 2: animate replays including fast forward and rewind, import and export - battle sim exports replay
phase 3: backend db to store replays and share via link

possible ideas

side: self play ai?
Array of weights for each stat
Array used as a seed to generate random build OR random seed to generate deterministic build
For mutation, modify the weights
e.g. generate 100 random builds -> round robin best of 100
fitness
win: 2
draw: 1
loss: 0
fitness function -> NN?
normalise score -> use as probability for pool selection

todo for phase 1
net eva multiplier
can mi/dodge then counterattack
should be able to eng shield when enemy frozen
assassinate should not heal after win

new branch for:
localStorage => indexedDB
fix typos
state to store ID instead of name - fighter, pet, gears, gems, skill, totem, pro/res, arena title
migration script to convert all saved builds into indexedDB

import/export replay json
check how ps does it

replay format

|player|id|<player json>
id = starts from 0 and increments, even = left, odd = right

|vs|<L id>|<R id>

|turn|<id>|<seconds>
|skill|<id>|<name>
|status|add/remove|<id>|<name>
|stat|add|<id>|<stat>|<amount>|<current>|<initial>|source|
|stat|remove|<id>|<stat>|<amount>|<current>|<initial>|source|crt/noCrt
|fury|<id>|<amount>|<current>|
|furyburst|<id>
|dodge|<id>
|parry|<id>
|win|<id>

ignore when animating, used for logging purposes
|info|message
|debug|message

requirements
initial state
desktop: profiles on left, logs on right
mobile: profiles on top, logs on bottom

left + right profile with scrolling
logs same height as battle, 300px on mobile

> after log generated, button to replay last fight (play button located left of score)
- replace profile with battle bg
(include little heads for multiple fighters in replay)

during fight button layout TBD
- button to restart replay

possible idea:
use turn to determine who is drawn first (useful in cases of overlap e.g lightningball)
