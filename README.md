# CF Whale Simulator
This aims to replicate battles in Chaos Fighters. Due to the nature of this game, it is impossible to 100% accurately depict certain behaviours (for example crit chance, dodge chance, bomb throwback chance, aotg switch chance). The best we can do is approximate them, so take the battle results with a grain a salt.
